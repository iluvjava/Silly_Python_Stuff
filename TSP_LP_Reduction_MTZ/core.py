    """
        This reduction has a polynomial number of constraints applied to the system, and it's formulated by
        Miller Tucker Zemlin.   
        Here are the variable:
            x_{i, j}: Going from city i to city j at some point during the tour.
                * Binary
                * Direction counts.
            u_i: The step city i has been visited.
                2 <= i <= n
                u_i = t, then it means that city i is visted at t step of the tour.
                0 <= u_i <= n - 1

        Additional Features:
        1. Greedy Coloring For forst solve
        2. Warm start for solving after changes has been made...
            * if the path is there, then each time a new added vertex will be included into
            previous best solution.
            * next time upon evalution, model will provides with this path for mid-starting the algorithm.
