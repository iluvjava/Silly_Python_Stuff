"""
    In this file we are going to visualize some of the inputs and outputs of the extended knapsack problem,
    so poeple and appreciated the algorithm in a visual way.


    * Items with different profits and weights are circles on the 2d planes.
    * The area of the circle is proportional to the number of available items in the inputs of the knapsack problem.

    * The solution it's filling in the circles with black color, so it's concentric circles I believe,
        ** Plot label a number besides it will be very helpful.

    * I don't know how to visulize the budget tho.
        ** Just plot a line, representing the ratio of the available budget and the total weights of all items.
